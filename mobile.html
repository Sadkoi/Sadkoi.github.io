            Computer science is a fascinating subject. By following a set of rules and leveraging those rules in 
            specific ways, you can create complex algorithms to do just about anything. Like, for example, creating your own world. 
            An eye for detail leaves little in the way of creating an engaging, jaw dropping game. That's what I strive towards. 
            You'll often find me typing away in Visual Studio Code, distraught but not discouraged after finding out my code
            doesn't <i>quite</i> work the way I wanted it to. Perhaps I'm designing a 3D drone on Fusion 360, or rigging an animated
            version of myself in Blender.<br> <br>
            <b>In my eyes, there are two types of people in this world: those who play games, and those who make them. </b><br>
